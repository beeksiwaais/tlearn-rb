# TLearn Ruby

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/beeksiwaais/tlearn-rb.png)](http://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/tlearn-rb)

Ruby helping make tlearn neural network simulator sane(ish) (http://crl.ucsd.edu/innate/tlearn.html)

To see an example run:

`rake example:train
rake example:fitness`

# Seriously? Just use FANN!

TLearn supports recurrent networks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), FANN does not. Recurrent networks maintain state, enabling the context of previous inputs to effect further outputs. 

While there have been attempts to add recurrent networks to FANN (http://leenissen.dk/fann/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47) these are still sitting on a dead branch that was never merged into master.

# Installing TLearn

`gem install tlearn`

#Usage


```ruby
require 'tlearn'

tlearn = TLearn::Run.new(:number_of_nodes => 86,
                         :output_nodes    => 41..46,
                         :linear          => 47..86,
						 :selected        => 1..86,
                         :weight_limit    => 1.00,
                         :connections     => [{1..81   => 0},
                                              {1..40   => :i1..:i77},
                                              {41..46  => 1..40},
                                              {1..40   => 47..86},
                                              {47..86  => [1..40, {:max => 1.0, :min => 1.0}, :fixed, :one_to_one]}])
                 
  
training_data = [{[0] * 77 => [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}],
                [{[1] * 77 => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}]
  
tlearn.train(training_data, sweeps = 200)

tlearn.fitness([0] * 77, sweeps = 200)
# => ["0.016", "0.013", "0.022", "0.020", "0.463", "0.467"]
```

You will often seperate the training and fitness process. By specifying a working directory when training you can reuse the training data for later
fitness evaulations.

```ruby
tlearn.train(training_data, sweeps = 200, working_dir='/training_session/')
```

```ruby
tlearn.fitness([0] * 77, sweeps = 200, working_dir = '/training_session/')
# => ["0.016", "0.013", "0.022", "0.020", "0.463", "0.467"]
```

Configuring TLearn (What the heck does all that config mean?)
=========

Yes, its complicated configuring this thing. Lets work through the different configuration options:

    #Total number of nodes in the network (not counting input).
    :number_of_nodes => 86

    #The nodes that are used for output.
    :'output_nodes' => 41..46

    nodes 1-10 are linear. Linear nodes ouput the inner-product of the input and weight vectors
    :linear_nodes => 1..10

    #nodes 1-10 are bipolar. Bipolar nodes output ranges continuously from -1 to +1.
    :bipolar_nodes => 1..10

    #weights between nodes will not exceed 1.00
    :weight_limit => 1.00

<h4>Connections</h4>
Here we specify how all of our nodes are connected, the architecture of the neural network. 

We use ranges to specify connections between nodes:

    1..3 => 4..6

Indicates connections:

    node 1 <- node 4 
    node 1 <- node 5
    node 1 <- node 6

    node 2 <- node 4
    node 2 <- node 5
    node 2 <- node 6

    node 3 <- node 4
    node 3 <- node 5
    node 3 <- node 6

Note that the nodes specified first (1..3) are the destination nodes, the second nodes (4..6) are the source nodes. The sources nodes feed into the destination nodes.

<p>Make sure you feed the input nodes into the network.</p>

    #1-6 nodes are fed input nodes 1-10.
    1..6 => i1..i10

<p>We can also add constraints to the different connections:</p>
    #nodes 1-6 connections with nodes 7-9 will have weights never less than 1 or greater than 10.
    1..6 => [7..9, {:min => 1, :max => 10}]

    #nodes 1-6 are fed from node 0 (node 0 is always the bias node).
    1..6 => 0

    #nodes 1-6 connections with nodes 7-10 are fixed at initiation values and will not change throughout learning.
    1..6 => [7..10, :fixed]

    #nodes 1-6 connections with nodes 7-10 are fixed at 2 and will not change throughout learning.
    1..6 => [7..9, {:min => 2, :max => 2}]

    #1-6 nodes connections with nodes from 7-9 are fixed at weight 1. 
    1..3 => [7..9, {:min => 1.0, :max => 1.0}, :fixed, :'one_to_one']

one_to_one changes the way connections are mapped. Instead of one node mapping to every other node we have a 1-1 mapping between nodes:

For example:

    node 1 -> node 7
    mode 2 -> node 8
    node 3 -> node 9
